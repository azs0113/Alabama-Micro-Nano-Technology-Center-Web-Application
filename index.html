				<h2>Welcome to Auburn Micro Nano Technology Center</h2>

				<p>
					Semiconductor technology is the driving force behind the birth of the Information Age, and is expected to become a $850B industry by the year 2005. A solid research and educational infrastructure is required to support the growth of this rapidly evolving and strategically important industry. The Alabama Micro/Nano Science and Technology Center (AMNSTC) was established in 1984, and has a mission "to advance microelectronics science, technology, and education by providing facilities which encourage interdisciplinary research and educational activities within Auburn University and the State of Alabama." This mission is accomplished by focusing on more basic long-term research while also addressing the shorter-term technological and manpower needs of the semiconductor industry. The AMNSTC has grown to include nine distinct laboratories in the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics, and Mechanical Engineering Departments. Over 30 faculty and staff, and over 50 graduate students are involved in its research activities. Research in the AMNSTC is highly interdisciplinary, reflecting the multi-faceted nature of the field of microelectronics. The AMNSTC enjoys strong industrial and government support for its numerous research programs, which ensures that student training and research results have direct relevance to industry and government needs. The AMNSTC is at the forefront of microelectronics research and education. We are excited about what we are doing, and we welcome the opportunity of sharing that excitement with you.
